SQL queries? Check them out here: [PROJECT 1](/PROJECT%201/)


# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

This data is packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, enabling me to query the database and uncover critical insights.

- **PostgreSQL:** The database management system I used, well-suited for handling large volumes of job posting data.

- **Visual Studio Code:** My workspace for managing databases and executing SQL queries efficiently.

- **Git & GitHub:** Crucial for version control, sharing SQL scripts, and tracking the progress of my analysis.

- **Excel:** Used for data cleaning and visualization, including building tables and charts to highlight trends and insights clearly.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the job market. Here's how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
Identify the top 10 highest-paying remote Data Analyst roles by filtering job postings with specified salaries, highlighting the most lucrative opportunities in the field.

---
```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    company_dim.name AS company_name,
    job_title,
    job_title_short,
    job_location,
    job_country,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN 
    company_dim on company_dim.company_id=job_postings_fact.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
```

### üîë **Insights**

1. **Massive salary ranges ‚Äì** The top-paying role (Data Analyst at Mantys, India) lists an average salary of $650,000/year, which is far above typical market rates. This could indicate executive-level data positions mislabeled as analyst roles or outliers in salary reporting.

2. **Geographic diversity ‚Äì** High-paying roles aren‚Äôt limited to one region:

    - United States (e.g., Citigroup, Illuminate Mission Solutions)

    - Belarus (–õ–ê–ù–ò–¢)

    - India (Mantys)

    This suggests lucrative opportunities for analysts exist globally, not just in the U.S.

3. **Seniority matters ‚Äì** Many top roles are senior or specialized analyst positions (Sr Data Analyst, HC Data Analyst, Senior, Head of Infrastructure Management & Data Analytics), highlighting how job titles beyond "Data Analyst" often correspond to higher pay.

4. **Full-time dominance ‚Äì** All top-paying positions are full-time, reinforcing that permanent contracts bring the best salaries in the data analytics space.

5. **Remote flexibility** ‚Äì Some postings list "Anywhere" as the location, suggesting companies are open to global remote hires for top-paying roles.

### üîë **Insights**

1. **High-paying niche skills dominate the list ‚Äì** Skills like SVN ($400K), Matplotlib ($234K), and Solidity ($179K) top the rankings, reflecting their association with specialized or senior-level roles rather than typical Data Analyst positions.

2. **Database and backend tools also command higher pay ‚Äì** NoSQL ($167K) and Oracle ($157K) appear in the top tier, showing the value of advanced database expertise.

3. **Core skills (SQL, Excel, Python) don‚Äôt lead in salary averages ‚Äì** While these are the most in-demand skills, their average salary is diluted across thousands of entry- to mid-level postings, keeping them off the very top-paying list.

4. **The trade-off between demand and salary is clear ‚Äì** Niche technical skills may open fewer opportunities but often lead to higher-paying roles, while mainstream skills ensure broader job accessibility.

**üëâ Takeaway:** SQL, Excel, and Python are essential to land a job, but learning complementary high-paying niche skills (like NoSQL, Matplotlib, or Solidity) can significantly boost earning potential.

![alt text](<PROJECT 1/assets/QUERY 4.png>)
*The top-paying skills for Data Analysts include SVN ($400K), Matplotlib ($234K), and Solidity ($179K), but these appear as niche or outlier skills rather than core analyst tools ‚Äî unlike SQL, Excel, or Python, which dominate demand but not necessarily average salary.*
